# Care-and-Welfare
Idea and vision of project:
1.As we know The conditions in goverment hospitals are not very good and because of this many lives are lost.
2.Quite often the necessary medical equipments are damaged or defected but never reported to the concerned authorities.
3.So we have tried to make a website which acts as a bridge between the hospital,patients and the concerned authorities which in our case is "MINISTRY OF HEALTH."
4.The patients can register complaints regarding malfunctioning of equipments which will be then reported to the hospital and Ministry.
5.This will put the Hospital on alert and also notify the Ministry about the current scenario of the facilities at the Hospital.
6.The users can also write an additional reveiw regarding the staff behaviour.
